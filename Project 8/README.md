## RabbitMQ example of the request-reply pattern using NodeJS (TS)

We have 2 microservices : RPC_Client and RPC_Server

Both of them play the roles of a Consumer and a Producer.

RPC_Client, produces to an RPC Queue, to which the RPC_Server will be consuming messages from. And will then process the data, and return a response by producing to the
Reply Queue, to which the RPC_Client will be consuming responses from.
